                <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
                <p>Making a website accessible for all means both content and design should be simple and clear so that 
                    most people can use it without needing to adapt it, while supporting those who do need to adapt things. 
                    Making the web more accessible is something we should all strive for, especially as 1 in 5 people have a 
                    long term illness, impairment or disability.
                </p>

                <h2>Mobile Accessible:</h2>
                <p>Making a website function well on multiple styles of devices helps most users as most browsing is 
                    done on mobile devices. Additionally, having optimised layouts for different screen sizes automatically 
                    improves the ease of access on more obscure devices. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Perceivability:</h2>
                <p>It is important to make sure users can recognise and use the service with the senses available to them.<br>
                    This has been achieved by providing 'alt text' on all images used - this allows screen readers to provide a 
                    description of the image to those who cannot see the image.<br>
                    Content is structured logically with all navigation coming before content to make it easier to find where the 
                    user wants to be. Colour is used for the navigation bar and the colour changes to signify selection, however 
                    this feature is not the only way to identify the current page. Each page has the page name at the top, the user 
                    will know when they use a navigational button as the mouse changes to a hand and a border is used to distinguish the buttons.<br>
                    All data visualisations can change colours when clicking on the graph, this allows the user to cycle to a combination 
                    that works well for them.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Operable:</h2>
                <p>Every page has a title to provide the user an understanding of where they are currently located.<br>
                    Navigation buttons are highlighted in multiple ways - colour and border. This makes sure the user knows 
                    where they will end up when using the navigation bar.<br>

                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Understandable:</h2>
                <p>All text is written in plain English so will be Understandable for all English readers.<br>
                    Features are consistant across all pages - navigation bar is common, each page has a title. 
                    This makes the website predictable.

            <section>
                <h2>Robust:</h2>
                <p>Modern and future browsers are supported with correct semantic elements. The use of a canvas makes 
                    some outdated browsers struggle with the 'Productivity' page.
