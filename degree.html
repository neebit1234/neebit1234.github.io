                <h2>My Degree</h2>
                <p>In the first year of Computer Science at Sheffield University there are many modules that teach both 
                    programming in various languages and lecture material from logic to software development. Learning 
                    is separated into modules labelled COM that each focus on a specific part of the course. Many modules 
                    overlap with some similarities and this helps understand the content.

                    <h2>COM1001 Introduction to Software Engineering:</h2>
                    <p>This module introduces the Software Engineering concepts 
                        that are needed to develop software systems that can meet 
                        basic functional requirements within a given problem domain. 
                        It covers the main steps in the process of developing such 
                        systems, from requirements analysis through to their implementation 
                        and testing.A major part of the module involves students working 
                        in teams to develop a web-based software system, which gives practical 
                        experience in teamwork and managing software projects and their products.

                <h2>COM1002 Foundations of Computer Science:</h2>
                <p>The course consists of (around) 10 blocks of 2-3 weeks work each. Each block develops 
                    mathematical concepts and techniques that are of foundational importance to computing. 
                    Lectures and problem classes will be used. The intention is to enthuse about these topics, 
                    to demonstrate why they are important to us, to lay the foundations of their knowledge 
                    and prepare students for future computing courses. It is not expected that the course 
                    will cover ALL of the maths that is needed later either in terms of depth or scope.</p>

                <h2>COM1003 Java Programming:</h2>
                <p>This module introduces programming concepts through the Java programming language. 
                    Program design and the use of testing to drive program creation are also covered. 
                    Initial focus is placed on the structured aspects typical of many programming languages: 
                    the ideas of a sequence, selection and repetition. The object-oriented approach to 
                    building large software systems from components is then presented. Throughout the 
                    module, emphasis is placed on the practice of writing well-structured and readable 
                    programs to solve problems.</p>

                <h2>COM1005 Machines and Intelligence:</h2>
                <p>This module provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and to key concepts 
                    and problems in the field, such as whether a computer is capable of understanding, 
                    and whether humans should themselves be viewed as machines. It also provides a 
                    brief historical overview of the subject and reviews the state-of-the-art and open 
                    questions in some of the major subareas of AI, pointing out connections to research 
                    work in the Department. As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues 
                    that underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence, the module also has a more 
                    practical component that introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem 
                    solving through practical programming examples, as well as hands-on experience with 
                    simple programming of robots. The emphasis here is on identifying the abstract nature 
                    of the problem which is to be solved, matching this to an appropriate algorithm or 
                    technique and implementing a solution. It also serves as an introduction to 
                    programming for research rather than for software engineering.</p>

                <h2>COM1006 Devices and Networks:</h2>
                <p>This module runs throughout the academic year, starting in Autumn and ending in Spring. 
                    The module consists of two parts. In the first, important elements of computer 
                    architecture are covered including digital logic, computer arithmetic and instruction 
                    set architecture. The approach in the module is to show how the basic elements of a 
                    computer are constructed and combined to give sophisticated architectures that support 
                    accelerated performance via cache memory and pipelining. The second half of the module 
                    shows how computing devices can be connected into networks, and covers the principles 
                    of layered protocols, error detection/correction and reliable transmission over networks.</p>

                <h2>COM1008 Web and Internet Technology:</h2>
                <p>This module is for students studying Computer Science as a main subject.The Web and the 
                    Internet are now pervasive in modern life, providing an information resource, 
                    supporting 'cloud computing', and promoting novel, interactive solutions to 
                    computing-related activities. This module will cover the basics of networks and 
                    internetworking, the Web in society, including information security and the technologies 
                    that are used in Web development, with an emphasis on building a simple interactive 
                    website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
