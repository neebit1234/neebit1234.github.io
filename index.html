                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Joel! I am a first year computer science 
                        student at the university of Sheffield. I am from a small village called 
                        Cottingham near Hull in England. Computing has been an interest of mine for many years. 
                        This started with Scratch when I recognised that I could create and play my own games. 
                        Whilst learning basic programming, I learnt to write Python code in class then independently 
                        challenged myself to manipulate it to develop my own programs.</p>
                    <p>My A-level project was an optimisation program aimed at helping students plan revision programmes. 
                        I decided on an optimisation program because it is a project which would be more 
                        extensive than just programming - for instance, it includes spreadsheets and complex 
                        algorithms and it would solve my time-consuming problem of creating revision schedules manually.</p>
                    <p>As a first year Sheffield student, I have attened many lectures and completed labs and assignments.
                        These have taught me many programming languages like Ruby, Java and html - JavaScript. Aswell as gaining 
                        knowledge on: AI and computer vision; Binary logic and CPU structure and Boolean logic and Logic Proof.

                    <h2>This website:</h2>
                    <p>This website is designed to promote myself (Joel Hunt) and my degree programme. While initially 
                        the website was designed for a first year assignment, it should be designed such that the website 
                        could be used in the future as a portfolio. Such a website allows employers to see your skills 
                        and what you have learnt and from where.

                    <h2>Work:</h2>
                    <p>I have completed an A-level project. The program was able to take in events and produce an efficient 
                        timetable. The program had three user levels: student, teacher and admin. Teachers could be admins 
                        and vice versa. Every user would see a timetable that would be a combination of a school timetable 
                        and a revision timetable. Every user object was related to specific classes so multiple students 
                        in the same class would recieve the same class at the same time. The project was written in C# and 
                        I belive it shows off many skills: complex algorithms (scheduling), OOP (user relation) and database 
                        management (saving user data in a relational database).
                    </p>
                    <p>At university I have completed many assignments: in COM1001, I have coded a shopping assistant in Ruby; 
                        in COM1003, I have made many Java programs such as a flat share and drawing encoded images; in COM1005, 
                        I have worked in a group to produce code for MIRO robots to traverse an unknown layout efficiently and in 
                        COM1008, I hhave produced a website that shows off my skills to future employers.

                    <h2>Hobby:</h2>
                    <p>As a young kid I participated in alot of recreational activities such as: Judo, instruments 
                        (clarinet and drums) and Scouts. As I got older, I stopped attending these to focus on school work.
                        In university I have joined NODDSOC - a D&D roleplaying society.
